# OneTrust 2.0

## Overview

OneTrust 2.0 is a next-generation privacy technology platform focused on Data Mapping, Catalog, and Regulatory Intelligence. This repository contains comprehensive implementation plans for deploying OneTrust 2.0 as a multi-tenant B2B SaaS application on major cloud platforms.

## Implementation Plans

### Cloud SaaS Implementation Plans

This repository contains detailed, enterprise-grade multi-tenant SaaS implementation plans for OneTrust 2.0 on both Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure:

- [GCP SaaS Implementation Plan](gcp_saas_implementation.md) - Comprehensive guide for implementing OneTrust 2.0 on Google Cloud Platform
- [Azure SaaS Implementation Plan](azure_saas_implementation.md) - Comprehensive guide for implementing OneTrust 2.0 on Microsoft Azure

Both implementation plans are designed for B2B requirements and include:

- Enterprise identity management
- Tenant onboarding with organization validation
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Enterprise-grade security features (BYOK, DLP, etc.)
- Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2, ISO 27001
- Organization-level API management
- Enterprise audit logging
- Real-time security monitoring

### Additional Implementation Documents

- [Data Map Implementation](data_map_implementation.md) - Implementation details for the data mapping component
- [Inference APIs Implementation](inference_apis_implementation.md) - Implementation details for regulatory intelligence APIs

## Cloud-Agnostic Architecture

The implementation plans provide a cloud-agnostic approach, allowing deployment on either GCP or Azure based on business needs, while maintaining consistent functionality, security, and compliance capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Separate databases per tenant for strong data isolation
- **Enterprise Identity**: Integration with customer identity providers via SAML/OIDC
- **API-First Design**: Comprehensive API layer with organization-level controls
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale from small businesses to large enterprises
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with encryption, RBAC, and audit logging
- **Compliance**: Built-in compliance with major privacy regulations
- **Operational Efficiency**: Leveraging managed services to reduce operational overhead

## Getting Started

Refer to the specific implementation plan ([GCP](gcp_saas_implementation.md) or [Azure](azure_saas_implementation.md)) based on your preferred cloud platform. Each plan provides a phased approach to implementation, starting with foundation setup and progressing through authentication, database implementation, application deployment, and monitoring.
